However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations.\n\n## Impact\nThis vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution.\n\n## Mitigation\nThis vulnerability is patched in json5 v2.2.2 and later. A patch has also been backported for json5 v1 in versions v1.0.2 and later.\n\n## Details\n \nSuppose a developer wants to allow users and admins to perform some risky operation, but they want to restrict what non-admins can do. To accomplish this, they accept a JSON blob from the user, parse it using `JSON5.parse`, confirm that the provided data does not set some sensitive keys, and then performs the risky operation using the validated data:\n \n```js\nconst JSON5 = require('json5');\n\nconst doSomethingDangerous = (props) => {\n  if (props.isAdmin) {\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as admin.');\n  } else {\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as user.');\n  }\n};\n\nconst secCheckKeysSet = (obj, searchKeys) => {\n  let searchKeyFound = false;\n  Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => {\n    if (searchKeys.indexOf(key) > -1) {\n      searchKeyFound = true;\n    }\n  });\n  return searchKeyFound;\n};\n\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\"}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \"Doing dangerous thing as user.\"\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n```\n \nIf the user attempts to set the `isAdmin` key, their request will be rejected:\n \n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"isAdmin\": true}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props);\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...'); // Error: Forbidden...\n}\n```\n \nHowever, users can instead set the `__proto__` key to `{\"isAdmin\": true}`. `JSON5` will parse this key and will set the `isAdmin` key on the prototype of the returned object, allowing the user to bypass the security check and run their request as an admin:\n \n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"__proto__\": {\"isAdmin\": true}}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \"Doing dangerous thing as admin.\"\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n ```","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h"},"1091170":{"findings":[{"version":"8.5.1","paths":["jsonwebtoken","@azure/web-pubsub>jsonwebtoken"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<9.0.0","module_name":"jsonwebtoken","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-qwph-4952-7xr6","cves":["CVE-2022-23540"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=9.0.0","cvss":{"score":6.4,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L"},"updated":"2023-02-27T23:46:57.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 9.0.0 or later","cwe":["CWE-287","CWE-327"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1091170,"references":"- https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken/security/advisories/GHSA-qwph-4952-7xr6\n- https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken/commit/e1fa9dcc12054a8681db4e6373da1b30cf7016e3\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23540\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qwph-4952-7xr6","created":"2022-12-22T03:32:59.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"jsonwebtoken vulnerable to signature validation bypass due to insecure default algorithm in jwt.verify()","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"# Overview\n\nIn versions <=8.5.1 of jsonwebtoken library, lack of algorithm definition and a falsy secret or key in the `jwt.verify()` function can lead to signature validation bypass due to defaulting to the `none` algorithm for signature verification.\n\n# Am I affected?\nYou will be affected if all the following are true in the `jwt.verify()` function:\n- a token with no signature is received\n- no algorithms are specified \n- a falsy (e.g. null, false, undefined) secret or key is passed \n\n# How do I fix it?\n \nUpdate to version 9.0.0 which removes the default support for the none algorithm in the `jwt.verify()` method. \n\n# Will the fix impact my users?\n\nThere will be no impact, if you update to version 9.0.0 and you donâ€™t need to allow for the `none` algorithm.
